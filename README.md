# AymanOsman, computational biologist
Hi there! Iâ€™m Ayman Osman, a computational biologist specializing in multi-omics research. My work focuses on integrating various omics data to uncover insights into complex biological systems, particularly in the context of cancer research. I have extensive experience in analyzing epigenomics, proteomics, and gene expression data analysis, utilizing both command line tools and R/Bioconductor for my analyses.

### Current Projects
Multi-Omics Integration: Leading a project that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomics data to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets in heart diseases. Developing analysis pipelines using bash and R/Bioconductor packages.
